- to come out of local minimum
  - increase temperature, decrease beta
  - incrementStepSize -> 
- the sequence of the moving particles
- moving 1 or 10 or all rafts at the same time. 
- decrease rejection rate
  - if rejection rate > 90%, decrease incrementStepSize
- 20s (15rps, 25rps, 60rps)
- look at psi6 as a termination point.
